\section{Discussion}
Interpret the findings and relate them to the original goals. Highlight trade-offs between accuracy, latency, and maintainability. Discuss external validity: how well the model transfers to new regions, seasons, or market conditions. Address ethical or operational risks, monitoring plans, and how model drift will be detected and handled.
