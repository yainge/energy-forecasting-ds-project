\section{Methodology}
Describe modeling choices and rationale. Outline baseline models, feature sets, and any hierarchical structure (zones, balancing areas). Specify train/validation/test splits, cross-validation strategy, and hyperparameter search space. Clarify loss functions and evaluation metrics (MAE, RMSE, MAPE, pinball loss for quantiles). Discuss model interpretability, uncertainty quantification, and constraints that reflect operational needs.
