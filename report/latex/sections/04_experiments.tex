\section{Experiments}
Summarize experiments run and their objectives. Provide a table of configurations (model type, feature set, horizon, hyperparameters) and note compute resources. Include training curves, validation performance, and any ablation or sensitivity analyses (e.g., effect of weather inputs, horizon length, or lag depth). Document reproducibility details: random seeds, code references, and data snapshots.
