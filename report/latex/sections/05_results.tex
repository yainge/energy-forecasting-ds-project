\section{Results}
Present quantitative results with confidence intervals where possible. Include tables comparing baselines and proposed models, and plots for error distributions and forecast trajectories. Discuss statistical significance, robustness across time periods or geographies, and operational impact (e.g., cost reduction or reliability gains). Note failure cases and diagnostic plots that reveal model weaknesses.
