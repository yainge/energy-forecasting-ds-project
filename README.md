Analyzing Electricity Market data using Machine Learning

The electricity market is influenced by various factors such as demand, renewable energy generation, weather
conditions, and fuel prices. Accurate forecasting and analysis are crucial for market participants to optimize operations
and make informed decisions.

## Objective
Work with Spanish historical electricity market data (find it on the ESIOS-REE webpage: https://www.esios.ree.es/es/mercados-y-precios ) to:
• Supervised Learning (Regression): Predict the day-ahead spot electricity price in Spain.
• Unsupervised Learning (Clustering): Group daily electricity price profiles into clusters to identify patterns.
• Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Reduce data dimensionality and test its effect on your models.

## Submission Requirements:
### Jupyter Notebook:
• Include all your code for data analysis, model development, and evaluation. Inside this file, SEPARATE the
different Tasks.
• Ensure the notebook is well-organized with clear explanations and comments.
