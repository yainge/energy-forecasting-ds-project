    "TASK 2) Develop a machine learning model (supervised) to forecast the Marginal electricity price in Spain (https://www.esios.ree.es/en/analysis/600?vis=1&start_date=26-09-2025T00%3A00&end_date=26-09-2025T23%3A55&compare_start_date=25-09-2025T00%3A00&groupby=hour). → Kaggle\n",
    "competition (https://www.kaggle.com/).\n",
    "To obtain the target data, access the Esios website(https://www.esios.ree.es/es/analisis/) and download historical spot electricity prices. Possible input data\n",
    "can also be searched on this website. Some general guidelines for developing your model are detailed below.\n",
    "1) Understand your data set. Use descriptive statistics and data visualization tools.\n",
    "2) Data analysis of the data. Important! Prepare your dataset. Clean it and transform it, if needed.\n",
    "3) Think about possible feature selection for your model.\n",
    "4) Split the dataset into training and test (the test set must be the one provided by Kaggle).\n",
    "5) Train your model using different ML.\n",
    "6) Evaluate your model, adjust hyperparameters and retrain it if needed.\n",
    "7) Validate your model using the following regression metrics: RMSE, MAE and R2.\n",
    "• Granularity: hourly.\n",
    "• Provide the test error metrics results using the test data from 01/09/2025 – 30/09/2025 (1 month)."
